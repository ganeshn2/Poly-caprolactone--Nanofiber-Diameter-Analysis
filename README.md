# Poly-caprolactone--Nanofiber-Diameter-Analysis from the Scanning Electron Microscopy Images

This study reports the diameter variations of poly(caprolactone) (PCL) nanofibers obtained from various regions of PCL non-woven mats. Besides the technical curiosity, fiber diameters play a vital role in determining the biological cell growth on the medical nanofibers (PCL nanofibers). In addition, fiber diameter determines the rate of drug/small molecule release from these polymers. 

Major differences between our published research on PEO nanofibers (https://github.com/ganeshn2/Nanofiber-Statistics-Project) and this research is the tendency of the fiber diameter of PEO fibers to be at the lower end, unlike PCL nanofibers which are almost always thicker and also forms beads. In addition, as we observed location-induced variations in the nanofiber diameters, we incorporated several additional regions for this study. 

Another difference is that we are currently working on utilizing semi-automated measurement systems (DiameterJ) as a comparison method to see if there is any significant advantage over tedious data collection method as reported in this repository. 

Data and analyses from semi-automated measurements will be updated in this repository once the analysis is completed.
